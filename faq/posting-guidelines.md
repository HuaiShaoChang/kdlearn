title: Guidelines to keep in mind when sharing on Koding's Activity Feed. 
importance: 5
---

### A few basic rules:
1. If your question in of the category “how do I…” then always check Koding University. Chances are high that we have a handy dandy guide for you.
2. Ask your questions in a way that would make it easy for others to answer. (hint: ask the question as if you were trying to answer it). More awesome “question asking techniques” [here](http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/).
3. Posts that contain any of these will be mercilessly deleted by the moderators and your account could be banned:
	* abusive, racist or derogatory posts
	* meaningless posts
	* referral links to 3rd party sites
4. If someone answers your question with a relevant answer, be polite and thank them (or go the extra step and “like” them!).
5. We all need to collaborate to keep the Koding community klean. Report any abuse to [abuse@koding.com](abuse@koding.com). Fight back on any abuse!
6. Don’t share private info (email address, phone number, etc.)
7. Use Markdown whenever possible (posting code fragments, links, images, etc.) Our handy Markdown guide can be found [here](http://learn.koding.com/guides/markdown/). Preview your Markdown before posting using the M↓ button.
8. When posting code, only post relevant portions. A good rule of thumb is not to exceed 10-15 lines.
9. Don’t ask for the Koding support team to help via a post here. Instead, hit us up at [support@koding.com](support@koding.com). We monitor that inbox constantly (visualize a Koder positioned like a Hawk, watching that inbox).
10. If you think you can remotely help someone, expert or not, just do it.
