title: How can I close the VM panel/sidebar to get more screen space?
importance: 4
---

Our computer screens come in all shapes and sizes and if you don't have a high res screen,
then the amount of space occupied by the VM panel/sidebar and the file tree can be a bit
too much. Did you know that both the VM panel/sidebar and file tree can be collapsed?

There are two ways you can collapse the sidebar and filetree.
1. Using collapse icons
2. Double click the panel dividers

### Using collapse icons
Both the sidebar and the file tree have handy icons that will cause the respective panels to
collapse. The animation below shows how.

the panel! To expand, click the logo. (see image below for an example).

#### Collapsing/Closing the file tree
