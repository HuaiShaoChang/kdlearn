title: How can I close the VM panel/sidebar to get more screen space?
importance: 4
---

Our computer screens come in all shapes and sizes and if you don't have a high res screen,
then the amount of space occupied by the VM panel/sidebar and the file tree can be a bit
too much. Did you know that both the VM panel/sidebar and file tree can be collapsed?

#### Collapsing/Closing the VM Panel/Sidebar
**Double click** the dividing column line between the VM panel and file tree and it will collapse
the panel! To expand, click the logo. (see image below for an example).


#### Collapsing/Closing the file tree
**Double click** the dividing column line between the file tree and the IDE/Terminal and it will collapse
the file tree panel! To expand, click the folder icon. (see image below for an example).

> type:tip
> The sidebar and filetree can only be collapsed when you are in the VM section of Koding.
> They cannot be collapsed when in Channels or Messages.
