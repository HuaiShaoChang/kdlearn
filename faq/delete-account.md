You do not have to contact Koding support if you wish to delete your account. Simply head over to [Account Settings](https://koding.com/Account/Delete) from where you can easily initiate the deletion process.

It would help us immensly if you can take the short survey presented on the account deletion screen we can understand why we lost you and how we can improve.
