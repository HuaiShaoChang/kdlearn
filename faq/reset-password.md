### How do I reset my password?
To reset your password, head over to [Account Settings](https://koding.com/Account/Profile). The password change
field is located at the bottom of the Profile tab.

Once you input the new password, the system will prompt you for the current password before making the change. Once
your password is verified, the password will be changed and you will also receive an email notification letting you
know that your password has been updated.

### How do I reset my password if I login using GitHub / Twitter / Facebook / Google+ etc.?
If you are logging into Koding using Twitter, Github, Facebook, Google+, etc. then you were not required to set up
a password when you first created your account. In a sitution such as this, follow the steps below to set up your 
password:
1. Log out from koding.com
2. Head over to the [password recovery](https://koding.com/Recover) page
3. Enter your email address and the system will send you an email with the link to reset/set your password

> Even if you set up a password using the steps above, you can still log in using GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, 
> Google+, etc. or you can use the new password to log in. Both will work.
