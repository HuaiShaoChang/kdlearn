title: How do I claim storage space earned through referrals?
importance: 2
---

If you have earned extra stroage space on your Koding account as a result of referrals
or other offers we've made available to our users, then reclaiming that earned space
is now easier than ever.

To add earned space to your VM, head over to VM settings and click the plus sign located
next to the disk size indicator (as shown in the image below).

Once you click the plus sign, you will be shown a modal that will allow you to resize 
your existing disk and add all or some of your earned storage.
