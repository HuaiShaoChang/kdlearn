Your ideal software development playground!</p><p>The Koding platform provides all you need to move your software development to the cloud. You will be up and running in minutes on your own cloud-based Linux boxes where you can learn programming languages like Ruby, Go, Java, NodeJS, PHP, C, C++, Perl, Python&#x2026;the list goes on! You can experiment with installing, configuring/hacking Wordpress, Laravel, Django, Bootstrap and a slew of others or fire up a MySQL, Mongo, or Postgres server with the click of a button. If clicking buttons is not your thing (yes, we are that way too!) then you also have your favorite vim and emacs right there.</p><p>Our collaboration features allow you to pair-program with your friends and colleagues by allowing you to share (in real-time) your web-based IDE, Terminal and white board. All Koding virtual machines come with full root access so you are not hindered in any way.</p><p>Signing up is easy and free! Leave your localhost behind and step into the future. Code in the cloud!</p></div></a></li><li><a name=support><h3 class=question itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Question><a href=/faq/support>How do I ask for support?</a></h3><div class=answer itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Answer itemprop=acceptedAnswer><p>If your question is not answered on Koding University, feel free to send us a <a href=mailto:support@koding.com>support request</a>.</p><p>Because we process a large volume of inbound emails every day, it may take us a few hours before we get to your message but we will get to it within 24 hours.</p><p>In the meantime, here are a few resources that may be helpful:</p><ul><li>The <a href=https://koding.com/Activity>Koding Activity Feed</a> (in case others are discussing a related issue and have a recommendation)</li><li>Requests for new guides can be sent <a href="mailto:learn@koding.com?Subject=Koding%20University%20Guide%20Request&amp;Body=Hi%20Team%20Koding%2C%0APlease%20add%20the%20following%20guide%20to%20Koding%20University%3A%20_____%0A%0AThanks%21">here</a></li></ul></div></a></li><li><a name=redeem-referrals><h3 class=question itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Question><a href=/faq/redeem-referrals>How do I claim storage space earned through referrals?</a></h3><div class=answer itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Answer itemprop=acceptedAnswer><p>If you have earned extra stroage space on your Koding account as a result of referrals or other offers we&apos;ve made available to our users, then reclaiming that earned space is now easier than ever.</p><p>To add earned space to your VM, head over to VM settings and click the plus sign located next to the disk size indicator (as shown in the image below).</p><p><img src=/faq/redeem-referrals/resizedisk.png alt="disk size indicator"></p><p>Once you click the plus sign, you will be shown a modal that will allow you to resize your existing disk and add all or some of your earned storage.</p><p><img src=/faq/redeem-referrals/resizeaction.png alt="disk resize"></p><blockquote class="warning fa fa-info-circle"><p>If you feel there&apos;s an error in your reported earned storage space, please <a href=mailto:support@koding.com>send us a note</a>.</p></blockquote></div></a></li><li><a name=change-username><h3 class=question itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Question><a href=/faq/change-username>Can I change my Koding username?</a></h3><div class=answer itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Answer itemprop=acceptedAnswer><p>In short no. Why...? It&apos;s because when you first create your account we provision a lot of support services in the background for your account and all of these would need to get updated. This becomes problematic if you have made changes to your VM (even if you have created one file). If you really want to change your username, the only option is to delete your current account and make a new one with the desired username.</p><p>But ... you can however , change your display name as seen associated with your the bulletin board posts. Just browse to <a href=https://koding.com/Account/Profile>https://koding.com/Account/Profile</a> where you may change &quot;Name&quot; and/or &quot;LastName&quot; as you would like them to appear to other koding users wherever you chat on koding. This quite niftily has the side-effect of changing your nick on all of you past postings instantaneously. Note that this feature does not in any way allow you to be anonymous. Anyone who clicks on your chat nick (whatever it may be at the time) will always see your canonical username in the URL of your profile.</p><p>So to be clear , you may change your display name at any time but this does not affect your login username or VM URL. As stated above that is your system UID and can not be changed.</p></div></a></li><li><a name=sidebar-collapse><h3 class=question itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Question><a href=/faq/sidebar-collapse>How can I close the VM panel/sidebar to get more screen space?</a></h3><div class=answer itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Answer itemprop=acceptedAnswer><p>Our computer screens come in all shapes and sizes and if you don&apos;t have a high res screen, then the amount of space occupied by the VM panel/sidebar and the file tree can be a bit too much.

In other words, it will change. Because of this, Koding gives you a <a href=/faq/vm-address>VM Address</a>, which will <em>always</em> point to your VM, regardless of IP changes, so this is what you usually want to use.</p><blockquote class="warning fa fa-info-circle"><p>IP addresses of &quot;Always On&quot; VMs don&apos;t change even after the VM reboots.</p></blockquote><p>If you have trouble finding your VM Address, <a href=/faq/vm-address>click here</a>.</p></div></a></li><li><a name=delete-account><h3 class=question itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Question><a href=/faq/delete-account>How can I delete my account?</a></h3><div class=answer itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Answer itemprop=acceptedAnswer><p>You do not have to contact Koding support if you wish to delete your account.

It is blank/empty which means that if you want to use <code>sudo</code>, all you need to do is as follows:</p><pre><code>sudo &lt;command you wish <span class=hljs-keyword>to</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>use</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>When you hit enter, the sudo level command you wish to run without a password prompt.</p><p>If you wish to, you can add a sudo password yourself. To do this, change user to root by typing:</p><pre><code><span class=hljs-title>sudo</span> su
</code></pre><p>and then create a password for the root user by typing:</p><pre><code>passwd
</code></pre><p>You will be asked to type in the new password twice. Once done, the new password you picked is the password you will need to use when using the <code>sudo</code> command from that point on.</p></div></a></li><li><a name=open-ports><h3 class=question itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Question><a href=/faq/open-ports>What ports are open on my Koding VM?</a></h3><div class=answer itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Answer itemprop=acceptedAnswer><p>Most Unix ports are available on Koding VMs. We do not block any TCP traffic (inbound or outbound). See the following list for open ports, as well as ports in use by default.</p><ul><li>Ports <strong>2</strong> through <strong>65,534</strong> are open.</li><li>Port <strong>80</strong> is taken by Apache, but this can be turned off to free up the port.

This is not editable.</p><p>We realize that most users will probably run into trouble trying to remember our creatively designed VM names (sorry, we had to make sure they were unique) so Koding VMs can also very easily be assigned a username based namespace (username.koding.io). This makes it easy to remember the domain name for your VM since it is your username! (Note: You can still reach the VM by using the system assigned name as described above.)</p><p>To assign your username based domain to a VM, follow these 2 easy steps:</p><ol><li>open the VM settings panel and click on &quot;More&quot; to reveal the domain settings (as shown in the image below)</li><li>toggle the switch next to your personal namespace to enable it for this VM. (Note: If you have more than one VM, you will be able to reassign the same namespace on other VM settings panels but only one VM can have the namespace applied to it at any given time.) <img src=/faq/vm-hostname/first.png alt="Personal namespace"></li></ol><p>In addition to this, Koding also allows you to create sub-domains so that if you want to configure your apache/nginx web server to serve multiple virtual hosts, it&apos;s easy to assign them all their own unique sub-domains. <a href=http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-to-serve-multiple-domains-using-virtual-hosts>Read more about virtual hosts.</a></p><p>To use this feature, head back to the VM settings panel and follow these 3 easy steps:</p><ol><li>click the (+) icon next to the &quot;Domains&quot; label to open up an input box where you can type in a new sub-domain. All you need to provide is the sub-domain, we will add the .username.koding.io part automatically. <img src=/faq/vm-hostname/second.png alt="Add subdomain"></li><li>once added, these sub-domains become available on the setting panels of all your VMs for easy reassignment</li><li>deleting a sub-domain is as easy as adding one! <img src=/faq/vm-hostname/third.png alt="Remove subdomain"></li></ol></div></a></li><li><a name=vm-poweroff><h3 class=question itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Question><a href=/faq/vm-poweroff>How do turn off my my Koding VM?</a></h3><div class=answer itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Answer itemprop=acceptedAnswer><p>To turn off your VM, simply type in <code>sudo poweroff</code> into a Terminal. This will start a graceful shutdown process for your VM and within a few minutes you will see the UI reflect the powered down state for your VM.</p><p>A <code>sudo shutdown</code> will shutdown (not power off) a VM...there&apos;s a difference. :)</p><p>And a <code>sudo reboot</code> will reboot your machine. Here is an example of the output after you type in the command:</p><pre><code><span class=hljs-attribute>kodingvm</span>: <span class=hljs-string>~ $ sudo reboot</span>

<span class=r>Broadcast message from kodingvm@kodingvm
