<p>Workspaces are fantastic for organizing your work. This new workspace, which lives inside the &apos;Workspaces&apos; folder of your home
directory, is a place where you can store all relevant and related files to a particular project. For example, if you
are working on multiple projects, its nice to have them separated as follows:
-|home dir
   -|Workspaces
    -| Project 1
    -| Project 2
    -| Project 3</p>
<p>Workspaces help keep your projects organized. You can create any number of workspaces. There are no limits.</p>
<p>Note: A workspace folder is just a regular folder so you can create any number of files and folders inside it.</p>
<p>As you move back and forth between your workspaces, Koding will remember everything about each workspace. This includes things
like IDE settings, files open, Terminals open, etc.</p>
<p>Enjoy and Happy Koding!</p>
