# PyroCMS Setup and Installation for Beginners

Before you continue reading this guide why not try a more easy way, using the [Koding Package Manager (kpm)](http://learn.koding.com/guides/getting-started-kpm/) and install PyroCMS using just one command:

```
kpm install pyrocms
```

***

This article will cover the basic steps on how to setup a blog using PyroCMS as the base.

## What's PyroCMS?

It's a really simple, flexible and community driven CMS built with the CodeIgniter PHP framework that has an on-growing community of developers and supporters around it.

After you've finished with the tutorial you'll have a brand new website that runs PyroCMS.

## Step-by-step PyroCMS

### Step 1.

Open up your [Koding](https://koding.com) Terminal and type in the following command to get you started.

```
cd Web
```

### Step 2.

Still in the terminal window download the source code like so:

```
wget https://www.pyrocms.com/downloads/v2.2.5
```

### Step 3.

We rename the downloaded file, unzip it and rename the newly created folder.

```
mv v2.2.5 v2.2.5.zip; unzip v2.2.5.zip; mv pyrocms-pyrocms-08759da pyrocms
```

### Step 4.

You will now be able to access the PyroCMS by following a similar URL:

```
http://KODING_USERNAME.koding.io/pyrocms
```
