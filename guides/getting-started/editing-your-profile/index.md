# Editing Your Profile

Your Koding profile is your public information page on Koding. Currently
it shows your Avatar, Name and Description, recent Koding activity, and
in the near future Badges and additional social information. In this
guide we'll go over the basic usage of your Koding profile.

## Getting to your Profile

To find your profile, look in the lower left of Koding, as highlighted
below.

Clicking on it will open your profile.

## Avatar, Name and Description

When viewing your profile for the first time, you'll see that your first
name is set to your Koding username, and your last name and description
are set to default values, as seen in the below image.

These default values are only seen by you, and if you double click them,
you can edit that field.

If you have one, Koding will use your [Gravatar][gravatar] by default, but if you head over to your account settings Koding also supports avatar uploads directly.
