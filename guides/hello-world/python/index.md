# Hello World in Python

## Introduction

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

## Implementation

The first thing you need to do is to create a file called `helloworld.py` in your Koding VM and paste the bellow snippet into it.

```
print "Hello World!"
```

To run the above file in your Koding VM, just open your Koding Terminal and type the following command:

```
python helloworld.py
```

## Explanation

```
print "Hello World!"
```

Since Python emphasizes code readability, the above line is pretty self explanatory. It will print out something (in the above case, a "Hello World!" string) on the screen.

And that's it!

You just wrote and ran your first Hello World in Python.
