Welcome to Koding

In this video weâ€™ll introduce you to the Koding Terminal.

To access your Terminal, select your Virtual Machine on the left hand side.

After your VM is started, you will see a Terminal prompt in the lower right portion of your Integrated Development Environment. 

With the Terminal, you are able to run commands on your Ubuntu Linux VM. All programs and languages are supported, and you have full sudo access, so you can customize your VM however you want.

The Terminal itself is fast and responsive. Vim, Nano, Tmux and anything else you throw at it, will work right out of the box.

By clicking the plus button next to the Terminal tab, we are able to create multiple Terminals. 

We can also split, merge splits, and even make the terminals Full Screen.

The Koding Terminal is an essential component for development, right in your browser.
