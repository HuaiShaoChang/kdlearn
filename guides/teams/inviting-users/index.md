## Basics

Inviting someone to your Team is as really easy. Simply click on the Invite Someone button and you’ll be able to fill in the email address, first name and last name, of your teammate(s). You can also send out multiple invitations at once.

Keep in mind that people you invite, as full team members, have the following capabilities:

* Create and join any channel on your team
* Create or be invited to private groups on your team
* Exchange direct messages with any member of your team
* Collaborate with other team members
* Have access to shared resources
* Provisioning new machines
