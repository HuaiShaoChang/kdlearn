### Name:

In this view you’ll be able to set your Team’s name. The name is (or includes) the name of your company.

### URL:

You can also view the Team url. When you first set up your team you’ll set this URL. 

> type:tip
> The Team URL cannot be changed after you created the Team.

### Allowed Domains:

Here you can specify a domain that is pre-approved for team membership. If someone registers for your team using an email address with this domain, they are automatically added to your team. This saves a lot of time for those teams that have a lot of members. If you need to enter multiple domains, you can separate them by commas. e.g. acme.com, acme-inc.com.

### Image:

You can personalize your Team by uploading an image. This is usually your company or team logo.

You have now made the first steps into personalizing your Team. If you have any questions or have any issues don’t hesitate to drop at [support@koding.com](mailto:support@koding.com) and will gladly help.
