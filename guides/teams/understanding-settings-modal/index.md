This guide will outline the basic things you can achieve with the Team Settings view. You will also be able to read about each of the feature in their respective guides.

In order to access your Team’s settings, open up the settings panel as shown below.

Once there you’ll see multiple tabs on the left. More info on each one of them below.

## Invitations

In the Invitations you’ll be able to invite users to your Team. So instead of emailing everyone the link to your Team on Koding you can send them a notification directly from Koding.

## Integrations

The Integrations tab will allow you to connect 3rd party services for your Team. Things like Github, Pivotal or Pagerduty are just a few example of things that can be integrated automatically in your Team on Koding. More integrations coming soon! If you would like to see a particular integration, please send us an email at [integrations@koding.com](mailto:integrations@koding.com)

## Stacks

In the Stack tabs you’ll be able to set up stack templates. Stack templates are the way you will define the virtual infrastructure for your Team. Each team member will receive a replica of this Stack Template.
