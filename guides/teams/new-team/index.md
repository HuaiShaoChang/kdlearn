# What is Koding for Teams?

Koding for Teams allows your team to get your own version of Koding. This means that you get to define, configure and deploy your own development stack. This gives your team the best cloud-based development environment where they can easily create and collaborate without the need to worry about configuring and installing anything.

Some additional benefits are:

1. You can onboard current and new team members to your dev environments in minutes (vs days or weeks).
2. allow team members to be productive starting from day 1.
3. collaborate with remote team members without messy installs.
4. have full control over your dev environments from a single dashboard.
5. audit and update your team’s deployed infrastructure as your needs evolve.
6. version control your infrastructure and take action on the outliers.
7. introduce open development principles within your team and organization.
8. super-charge the aging developer localhost based workspace with new capabilities which in turn boosts your overall team productivity.
9. easily integrate 3rd party services and applications like GitHub, Pivotal, Asana, etc.
